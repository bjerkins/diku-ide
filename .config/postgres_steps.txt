Here are the steps I took to upload the data to Amazon RDS PostgreSQL server

1. Connect to the Database using some postgresql client, I used pgAdmin

2. To import all the data to the table, there needs to be some informaton 
   about the columns of the table, so there is a script that extracts the column
   names from the data and packs it in a `CREATE TABLE` script. Run it by doing

   ```sh
   	./mktable.sh CLIWOC15.csv
   ```

3. Create the table using the script output

4. Import the data.
