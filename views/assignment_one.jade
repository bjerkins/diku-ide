  p Here below you'll find our answers to the questions in Assignment 1. 

  h3 1. Webserver

  p We are using #[a(href="https://heroku.com") Heroku] to host our web server. In order to publish changes to the page, one has to request access to the Heroku application. Once that is done, download and install the #[a(href="https://toolbelt.heroku.com/") Heroku toolbelt]. Then login to your Heroku account using the toolbelt as such:

  pre $ heroku login

  p Publishing the application to Heroku is then just like pushing code to your repository. Start by cloning the project:

  pre $ git clone git@github.com:bjerkins/diku-ide.git

  p and then add a new repository (within the project) using the toolbelt:
  
  pre $ heroku git:remote -a diku-ide

  p Now you can make changes to the website and push them to both #[code origin] and #[code heroku]:

  pre $ git add .
    | $ git commit -m 'made some changes'
    | $ git push origin master
    | $ git push heroku master
