    p In order to implement the tootip, I created a new variable called "tootip" in the file "pca_scatter.js", appended it to to the body with the class name "tooltip" added it to the scatter plot when it is drawn. I implemented a "mouseover" and a "mouseout" interactivity so that the tooltip will appear above a dot in the scatter plot when the mouse hovers over it and will fade away after a certain duration. In addition I added a style for the tooltip in the "assignment_three.scss" style file, to give it its attributes (height,width, font, etc.).
