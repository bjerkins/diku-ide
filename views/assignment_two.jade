    p The following is a Radar Chart showing the same dataset as in the visualization from above.

        p Here on the right you can multi-pick years that you want to compare together.
      .col-md-6
        select(id="year-picker" class="form-control" multiple)

    p Visualizing the change in the temperature is a good start to get a feeling of how the weather has been changing. However, in places like Iceland where the warmest average temperature is 11° degrees, the amount of degrees don't tell the whole story. The difference between the "feels like" temperature and the actual is usually a bit higher when compared to Denmark, for example, due to the low humidity in Iceland. A warm and sunny day can be a little as 16° and it would feel like 20-22° here in Denmark. The wind has also a lot to do with it as well as the amount of precipitation. Therefore, a nice visualization would include these metrics (wind, precipitation, humidity and feels-like) and display them perhaps in a multi-dimensional (one dimension pr year) line-plot to get a better overview of the changing weather. Most often, we are interested in comparing season to season, so the interactivity would allow skimming through the seasons year by year. Below is a mock-up sketch of the idea. Note that I'm only showing one of the data dimension (the temperature, for example).

    p I will focus on the box-plot visualization for this section - because that is the static one and made from scratch.

    p It is not hard to see that with a hundred+ years, the visualization is very cluttered; having a box for each year. We could have added a "group" function where the user could choose the number of boxes. Say, we have 100 years, the user chooses 10 boxes, then we would average the values from year 0 to 9 in the first box, year 10 to 19 in the second, and so forth. 

    p Another similar approach (to reduce cluttering) would be to add a time line slider below the chart - e.g. like the one found here: #[a(href="http://bl.ocks.org/DStruths/9c042e3a6b66048b5bd4") D3 chart with interactive time line slider].

    p Lastly, we could add simple, yet very informative, legends on hover. E.g., such that the user can hover over a box and see the data representing that box. As the visualization is now, you almost need a ruler glued to your screen to read the values from a box.
