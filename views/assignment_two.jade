    h3 2. Motivation, method, results/discussion and conclusions.

    p The dataset that we picked to illustrate includes the recorded temperatures for Thessaloniki city in Greece. The dataset that we chose was based on the visualizations that we chose. At first we picked a city that had minus zero temperatures, but we came across problems with the visualization causing the radar chart to not show data correctly.  

    p As it can be observed from the Box-plot visualization, on one hand, through out the past 100 years, the maximum temperature can increased, starting from 25° in 1905 and reaching up to 30° in 2012. 

    p On the other hand, it is visible that the average temperature remained relatively the same (14-16°), along with the minimum temperature. In addition we can see a pattern regarding the minimum temperature. It can be observed that there is a certain "circle" of temperature recordings that repeats every few years. 

    p As a result, the minimum temperature keeps going up and down again at around the same levels as a few years back. However, as the years pass the deviations become smaller and less noticeable.

    p The same can be observed from the Radar chart, although, in this case we can have a more detailed view of the months for each year. Generally, there is a heart shape if we click various years, because January and February usually have the lowest temperatures. However, as the years pass we see that the shape gradually even out to become a circle, because these months start having higher temperatures. But we mentioned before the temperature "cycle" can also be observed here, thus making the heart shape in the last 20 years reappear.

    h3 3. Individual parts

    h4 3.1 (Bjarki)

    p Visualizing the change in the temperature is a good start to get a feeling of how the weather has been changing. However, in places like Iceland where the warmest average temperature is 11° degrees, the amount of degrees don't tell the whole story. The difference between the "feels like" temperature and the actual is usually a bit higher when compared to Denmark, for example, due to the low humidity in Iceland. A warm and sunny day can be a little as 16° and it would feel like 20-22° here in Denmark. The wind has also a lot to do with it as well as the amount of precipitation. Therefore, a nice visualization would include these metrics (wind, precipitation, humidity and feels-like) and display them perhaps in a multi-dimensional (one dimension pr year) line-plot to get a better overview of the changing weather. Most often, we are interested in comparing season to season, so the interactivity would allow skimming through the seasons year by year. Below is a mock-up sketch of the idea. Note that I'm only showing one of the data dimension (the temperature, for example).

    h4 3.2 (Thomas)

    p I will focus on the box-plot visualization for this section - because that is the static one and made from scratch.

    p It is not hard to see that with a hundred+ years, the visualization is very cluttered; having a box for each year. We could have added a "group" function where the user could choose the number of boxes. Say, we have 100 years, the user chooses 10 boxes, then we would average the values from year 0 to 9 in the first box, year 10 to 19 in the second, and so forth. 

    p Another similar approach (to reduce cluttering) would be to add a time line slider below the chart - e.g. like the one found here: #[a(href="http://bl.ocks.org/DStruths/9c042e3a6b66048b5bd4") D3 chart with interactive time line slider].

    p Lastly, we could add simple, yet very informative, legends on hover. E.g., such that the user can hover over a box and see the data representing that box. As the visualization is now, you almost need a ruler glued to your screen to read the values from a box.
